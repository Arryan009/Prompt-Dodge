# Prompt-Dodge

A game created using python including its libraries like pygame, random and sys

pygame is a Python wrapper for the SDL library, which stands for Simple DirectMedia Layer. It is used to make video games for cross platforms like winodws, mac and linux.

How does it work?

Car Race Game:
Movement and Collision:

You've set up basic movement and obstacle generation well. However, to smooth out the game, ensure obstacles and trees are removed from the list when they go off-screen to save memory.
Generating Trees:

It looks good that trees are generated outside the road bounds. The generation rate can be tweaked depending on how frequent you want them to appear.
Collision Handling:

The collision detection logic seems correct. Once the car collides with an obstacle, it ends the game. You could add a "Game Over" screen here to give feedback to the player.
Possible Enhancements:

Add score and level progression to give players a sense of achievement.
Include sound effects for collision and background music to enhance the user experience.
Engineering Quiz Game:
Quiz Flow:

You've set up engineering prompts and answers for a text-based quiz well. Make sure each question is displayed one at a time, and after answering, the game progresses to the next one.
User Input:

Since you're working in Pygame, handling user selection can be done using pygame.mouse.get_pos() to detect mouse clicks or using keyboard inputs to select options.
Scoring System:

Adding a score system would be useful to give feedback on how many correct answers the player has selected.
A Possible Code Structure:
For both games, I suggest having separate functions to manage distinct parts like input handling, game logic, display updates, and game flow. This will keep your code organized and modular.
